### c) The game concept

The game is heavily inspired by "Plants vs Zombies", an horizontal tower defense mobile game.

You get to place Archers on the board by clicking on a cell, it will shoot at incoming enemies on its line. You have to prevent any enemy to reach the left side of the gaming board.

The waves of enemies increase in number and speed over time. Your score is tracked and displayed on the game over page.
